### What is Octopus AI
A collaboration of professors, researchers and companies to experiment
with novel ideas to reach Artificial general intelligence.
### Why the name?
I always found fascinating that Octopuses are so intelligent, given
that our last common ancestor with them predates the genesis of sight
during the cambrian explosion (750 million years vs 500 million years).

They developed intelligence in a completely different way than us, and all other vertebrates. 

I decided to name the project Octopus AI to state the intent of
abandoning the mainstream approach of autoregressive Language models for
a bolder, from scratch approach on how to build intelligent systems.

### How did it start
After having been in management consulting for one year, it was finally 
came the time for me to stop looking at the AI revolution from the sidelines, and
start participating in it. 

After attending some open courses form stanford, the MIT, University of Pisa and Oliver Wyman, 
I wanted to start researching on my own. I soon discovered that doing research on this 
topic is amazing, but is very hard to do it alone. Octopus AI is the way i found to be
completely free in my research agenda, while being able
to exchange ideas and get feedback from other professors, researchers and companies. 

# Main Projects

- [**gpt2**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/gpt2)
  - Skills: Pytorch, Transformers, Language Models Architectures
  - Stage: Core functionality almost completed, still experimenting
  - Description: Trained from scratch a GPT2 sized model on my Macbook, and experimented with variations of the architecture

- [**frameformer-architecture**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/frameformer-architecture)
  - Skills: AI Research, Langchain
  - Stage: Core objective reached, still experimenting
  - Description: an attempt to find a novel architecture to reach AGI.
  Built a self-improving LLM agent that leverages the scientific method 
  and experiments to build a model of the world.

- [**probabilistic-rnn**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/probabilistic-rnn):
  - Skills: RNNs, stochastic processes
  - Stage: Core idea working, refinements needed
  - Description: Invented a RNN architecture that instead of forgetting past information
  exponentially with the distance does it with a power law behaviour with tunable exponent.

- **llm-monte-carlo-tree-search**:
  - Skills: LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, MCTS
  - Stage: Early stage, main components working (MCTS, Local LLM)
  - Description: An attempt to use MCTS to explore the decoding paths of LLMs and choose the best one.
  This work is analogous to AlphaZero, where chess moves are replaced by word choices, and a game is a sentence.
